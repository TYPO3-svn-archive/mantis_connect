Example of TypoScript (in plugin's configuration) to map fields from Powermail to Mantis:

connectors.powermail {
	project.cObject = TEXT
	project.cObject.field = uid5

	summary = Problem sent from my website...
	description.cObject = TEXT
	description.cObject.field = uid1
}

'project' is retrieved from field 'uid5' in Powermail which was defined as "Typoscript object"
being

plugin.tx_mantisconnect_func.projects

which automatically generates a list of available projects. WSDL, username and passwords are
read from TypoScript configuration!
